# Palindrome in Python

This program returns the longest palindrome that can be gotten from the string entered by the user

## Quick Notes
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar. 
Sentence-length palindromes may be written when allowances are made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers, such as "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!", "Was it a car or a cat I saw?" or "No 'x' in Nixon".
```
	This program deals with stings without SPACES only...

```
When the program runs, it asks for a string... Enter a string without SPACES in between the letters
```
Example: madameabracadabrapadap
```
Output:
Enter a string (no SPACES) and the program will return the longest palindrome in the string
-->madameabracadabrapadap
The possible palindrome(s) in 
*** madameabracadabrapadap ***
Are: -->ada, madam, aca, ada, apa, ada, padap<--
